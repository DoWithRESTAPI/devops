Jenkins is an open source continuous integration server that provides the ability to continuously perform automated builds and tests. 
Several tasks can be controlled and monitored by Jenkins, including pulling code from a repository, performing static code analysis,
building your project, executing unit tests, automated tests and/or performance tests, and finally, deploying your application. 

These tasks typically conform a continuous delivery pipeline.
